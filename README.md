## 📖 What This Is

This repository is just my own little Java memory bank.

I’m using it to practice core data structures from scratch and make sure I actually *understand* what’s going on. Everything here is written with real examples and comments that explain what the code is doing (not just what it is).

It’s also nice having all of this in one place for interviews, class, or whenever I forget how to write a linked list node again.

## 🔢 Arrays

Folder: `/arrays`

This section covers all types of arrays in Java. Each file has comments that break down what’s happening so I don’t have to figure it all out again later.

| File Name                | What It Does                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `ArrayExample.java`      | Simple loop through a 1D array, find max          |
| `TwoDArrayExample.java`  | Loop through a matrix with nested for-loops       |
| `ThreeDArrayExample.java`| Build a cube (3D array) and print coordinates     |
| `JaggedArrayExample.java`| Rows with different lengths (jagged array)        |
| `ObjectArrayExample.java`| Store custom Student objects in an array          |
| `WrapperArrayExample.java`| Using `Integer[]` and adding them up             |
| `CharArrayExample.java`  | Breaking a word into letters with a char array    |
| `BooleanArrayExample.java`| Flags and ON/OFF switches using booleans         |

## 💭 Why I'm Doing This

I forget stuff. Especially the little stuff like array syntax, loop patterns, or how to do an in-order traversal. So this repository is basically my way of locking it all in. I'm writing it like future-me is going to be looking back at it needing help.

Also helps when I'm working on other projects or prepping for interviews — I can just come here instead of searching 15 Stack Overflow posts. (<--i know everyone can relate to that or W3 schools)

## 🔗 Someday To-Dos

- Add time/space complexity notes

## ⁉️ Suggestions
- If you somehow have made it this far and you have a cool idea or suggestion that I should add, *please* let me know!
